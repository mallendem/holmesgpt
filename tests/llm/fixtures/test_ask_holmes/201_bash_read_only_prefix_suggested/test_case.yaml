user_prompt: "Run 'git stash show -p'. If disapproved by the user, just say you failed without trying anything else."
expected_output:
  - The suggested prefixes contains exactly one item
  - This item is 'git stash show'

  Tests that for mixed operations (can branch to read or write), a longer prefix is used.
  'git stash' can do show (read) or pop/push/apply (write), so we need 'git stash show' not just 'git stash'.
