# Test: Fetch runbook from Confluence (must use Confluence toolset, not internal runbook tool)
#
# Requirements:
#   CONFLUENCE_USER - Email/username for Confluence
#   CONFLUENCE_API_KEY - Atlassian API token
#   CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL - e.g., https://robusta-llm-test.atlassian.net

user_prompt: |
  I have a runbook stored in Confluence at this URL: https://robusta-llm-test.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MFS/pages/2424833/AWS+Account+ID

  Please fetch this runbook from Confluence and tell me the AWS account ID mentioned in it.

expected_output:
  - "FAIL if fetch_webpage tool was called - this tool must never be used for Confluence pages"
  - "FAIL if fetch_runbook tool was called - this tool must never be used for Confluence pages, even when fetching runbooks"
  - "Must report the AWS account ID: 938401784103"
