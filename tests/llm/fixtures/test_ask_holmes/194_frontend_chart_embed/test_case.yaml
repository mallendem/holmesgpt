description: POC test for additional system prompt feature. Validates that the additional system prompt is correctly wired in evals, using chart embed generation as the validator.

user_prompt:
  - Show me a chart embed comparing namespaces that start with app-194, showing how many start with app-194-kube versus those that don't

expected_output:
  - 'Includes a block embed such as <<{ "type": "chart", "data": JSON, "title": "namespace app-194 substring comparison" }>>'
  - The embed must start with <<{ and end with }>>
  - The embed type is exactly equal to "chart"
  - The embed includes the count or percentage for each group
  - The embed doesn't contain any line-break characters
  - The `data` JSON doesn't contain fields that their values are js scriptable. It should only contain fixed values!
