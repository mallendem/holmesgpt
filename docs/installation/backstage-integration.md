# Integration with Backstage (3&#8203;rd party)

There’s now a third-party integration that brings **HolmesGPT** by **Robusta.dev** directly into Backstage. The integration is currently available in **closed beta**.

Instead of jumping between dashboards, logs, and consoles, you can ask questions directly from the Backstage component you’re already looking at. HolmesGPT then runs an automated investigation on your behalf.

Because Backstage entities already contain rich metadata, HolmesGPT can tap into:

-   Service documentation
-   CI/CD pipeline data
-   Kubernetes deployment status
-   Runtime metrics
-   APIs and dependencies
-   And more

All of this context is used to build a targeted investigation tailored to the specific service.

Below is a short walkthrough of the HolmesGPT–Backstage integration. It demonstrates how to start an investigation, inspect the investigation plan, and understand why a service may be failing, including reviewing the root cause analysis generated by HolmesGPT.
